## The ATOM 6-Point **Saving Plan** (Cost-Saving Guarantee)

This is a commercial program focused on lowering the **total cost** of managing “the little things” (products, processes, inventory) — **not** an environmental policy. If, after working the plan, ATOM doesn’t save you on total cost, ATOM refunds the difference. Details: [6-Point Saving Plan](https://www.atom.com.au/about-atom/6-point-plan)
